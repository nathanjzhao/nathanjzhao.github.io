title: Papers I Like
---

A collection of papers that have influenced my thinking or that I find particularly interesting.

<div class="timeline-entry">
  <div class="timeline-date"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08931">CLONE</a></div>
  <div class="timeline-content">I particularly like how they utilize <a href="https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO">lidar odometry</a> to estimate global position, maintaining consistency with the teleoperator. Their mixture of experts training system for humanoid RL is novel and represents a creative application I haven't seen before in this domain.</div>

  <div class="timeline-content">I like how they use guided diffusion for high-level controls - it's a very creative use case with many useful emergent properties. Diffusion works are always interesting to me because I can think about <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02747">flow matching</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01469">consistency models</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02502">DDIM</a>, and <a href="https://diffusion-steering.github.io/">diffusion steering</a> improvements, which lets us take proven concepts from image/video generation and apply them here.</div>
