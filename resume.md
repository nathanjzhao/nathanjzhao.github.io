## Work History

### **Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)**
*Sep 2024 - Present*
- Developing dynamics-guided diffusion policies for manipulation of deformable materials by leveraging a transformer as a dynamics model for latent autoencoder representations of camera point cloud.
- Generating data using a custom simulator built with Taichi for accurate and efficient physics-based simulations.
- Optimizing test-time FID results by applying gradients to guide diffusion policies, inspired by classifier guidance in diffusion models for image and video generation.

### **K-Scale Labs**
*May 2024 – Present*
- Developed quantized OpenVLA for the open-source robot "Stompy" using bitsandbytes, focusing on CUDA integration.
- Led PPO and physics simulator development with MJX and JAX, exporting Flax models with Tensorflow.js for inference.
- Integrated quantization methods into PyTorch by coding at the Python/C++ interface with Pybind.

### **Stanford University School of Medicine**
*Sep 2023 - Dec 2024*
- Developed deep learning models with Pytorch and Weights & Biases to identify Right Ventricular insertion points for AHA Segmentation model on cDTI MRI images.
- Created an annotation system using AWS S3 for efficient data management.
- 4th in lab's team for MICCAI 2024 MRI Reconstruction Challenge. Utilized variable splitting with CG method for data consistency, adaptive algorithm unrolling according to sample rate, and prompt blocks according to sample distribution to reconstruct undersampled MRI images.

### **Jane Street**
*Mar 2024*
- Achieved 1st place in an intensive quantitative trading program by developing high-frequency arbitrage trading bots.
- Conducted manual arbitrage strategies with ETFs to identify real-time opportunities and maximize returns.
- Built a deep understanding of arbitrage mechanics and market dynamics in a live-trading environment.

### **University of Delaware**
*Feb 2021 - Dec 2022*
- Led an independent investigation on phosphorene's anisotropic properties, publishing results on ChemRxiv and presenting at conferences including but not limited to the American Physics Society and Society of Engineering Science.
- Conducted quantum simulations (LAMMPS, SIESTA) and analyzed DFT data, modeling stress-strain responses and identifying novel anisotropic material applications.
- Published conference proceedings, demonstrating applications in flexible electronics, catalysis, and fracture-resistant materials.

### **The Summer Science Program** 
*Jun 2022 - Jul 2022*
- Designed procedures and characterized UmCdc14 phosphatase protein using wet-lab methods and MOE drug-discovery software.
- Conducted homolog modeling, ligand docking, BLAST sequencing, and other computational techniques for enzyme inhibitor design. 
- Published data into Purdue's research repository after writing a comprehensive report.
