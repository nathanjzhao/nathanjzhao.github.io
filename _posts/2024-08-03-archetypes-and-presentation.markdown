  Fitting the cracked "Stanford CS" stereotype
---

Last week one of my friends was talking about how some people we knew tried making it clear to many people that they were actually majoring in Symbolic Systems and not Computer Science (if you're non-Stanford, SymSys is just CS + Psychology + Linguistics + Neuroscience + etc. --- I've never really looked into it, but some have said it's a CS major for indecisive people. It genuinely does seem interesting though). My friend's assessment for why they claimed the major, despite being very much CS according to their LinkedIn, their presentation, and their goals of just purely making money, was simply so that they could look more "human." Majoring CS at Stanford, allegedly, was a bad aesthetic --- though they certainly didn't think that when utilizing Stanford's CS rep to extract funds from VCs despite not having much real CS experience. Majoring CS at Stanford, allegedly, implies that you fit a certain archetype. 

The above is sort of a tangent, but generally, this idea of archetypes has been very interesting to me. An acquaintance first mentioned it to me because I grabbed dinner with him and --- because I oddly thought it would be interesting --- I was wearing a funny hat with sunglasses. He said that not fitting the *idea* of someone who does CS, someone who should wear hoodies and t-shirts, is often not beneficial for social situations. It's harder to be bucketed as *one thing*, harder to process in the viewer's mind, and therefore easier to categorize poorly and maliciously. You can't be memorable by a first impression if you're too many things.

I think this has interestingly been true, although I never thought about it explicitly. I often cannot talk about the poetry I've published, the music I improvise, or the (admittedly pretentious) films I love in circles where people imagine me abstractly as someone who is only good at computer science. Bringing it up would be awkward, and I imagine it'd decredit my CS skills if the group didn't know me well enough. Even as a reader who might not know me in real life, you may think that I'm less of a "committed CS student" if I've done too many things other than just CS. I may appear as a jack of all trades, a master of none --- although otherwise, I may have appeared as a master.

Even to a very large extent, I can't talk about other STEM things, whether my research in material science or my placements in olympiads that weren't math or computer science. It'd appear as if I could very easily sway away from computer science as well, or as if I may revert back to these past STEM topics rather than becoming a committed startup founder, quant, or something of that sort.

### The fact is,
I hope that there is a meta-archetype, or an easy way where I can present myself as not as someone who does too much, but as someone who does a lot and still does well. And I know the way to present myself this way is by being more open about my accomplishments, even if it feels unnatural to me to brag.

But I think this is another question of [being serious](/being-serious). So what is it? Yes, I am doing state-of-the-art MRI Reconstruction research. Yes, I do have numerous hobby projects that I could launch as products. Yes, I am implementing and parallelizing machine learning models from scratch at a startup. Yes, I do have the capacity to found a startup, work at a quant firm, be a proficient software engineer, or anything. And I still have the ability to do everything else I enjoy in life.

The most interesting thing: if I were serious, this would be a great accidental way to brag. Maybe I could accidentally continue to keep this consistently as my most recent blog, and alter the dates of my other blogs. The commit history is the only truth. After all, who doesn't appreciate a creative use of rhetoric? If you don't tell people who you are, who will?
