  Thinking more about what's actually best.
---

This is the start of a blog that I'll hopefully be serious enough about to continue.

I think it's generally true that I find many things to be sort of a game --- of all things, especially learning, success, and any task with a measurable objective. This has of course been very beneficial to me. I can treat learning as a game, not stress, and still end up having retained more knowledge than I would have before just because I truly enjoyed every aspect of learning (cf. Rancho from 3 Idiots). I can do assignments and projects far before their assigned deadlines simply out of enjoyment, coasting on my curiosity. Meanwhile, I admittedly sometimes look at others as they cram or stress about how they are "not good enough," and wonder why they can't either
1. Enjoy the process rather than be motivated by being good or far-away idea of *success*.
2. Find something they would truly enjoy doing and be very good at it --- just because they want to.

But of course, that's not how the real world works. Tangent aside, this general "success" of my nonchalance has often led to me not seriously pursuing opportunities, either because they seem to offer prestiege (and no truly interesting learning) or because they are surrounded by people who --- as within point 1 --- seem to pursue the opportunity out of narcissism and other rather uninteresting motivations. Particularly, he latter makes the possible learning of the opportunity feel sluggish and uninviting

Personally, I have been content with this "missing out." Not applying to jobs as urgently as I should (because I have numerous project ideas that I'd love to tinker with over the summer, recommended books that I'd love to read, and besides --- I've never heard too many good things about these beuracratic and highly "code-monkey" internships), I obviously didn't feel the best when others were able to network --- 90% of the time by a family member --- into internships. However, despite this, I've had the general mentality that I was still doing the right thing, just because I was spending the time I could've spent applying to these jobs working on my own personal projects. I did hackathons, math problems for fun, cool MRI research, hung out with my friends, and accumulated various experiences that should not be replaced by the monotony of keeping up with application dates. Concisely, I'd like to think that I invested into maybe not an expected future, but rather into the person that I intrinsically am.

Of course, this "job application season" is an analogy to all other things I should take seriously. Whether college applications, my standardized tests, or other processes that feel rather systemic and nonconstructive instead of fulfilling. Luckily, my life path has turned out okay by a little luck and my vague intuition to level into doing these systemic things when there is nothing better to do (because yes, these systemic things are obviously still important).

That being said, I've never wanted to change this casual attitude towards systemic things, aside from the slight "huh. interesting"'s when the world seems to favor people who would rather spend more time saying they are experts rather than actually getting to learning they apparently know. To some extent, I may have *too* strong of a sense of self for my own good.

However, recently, I've been told that I need to take things more seriously by my boss [Ben Bolte](https://github.com/codekansas) (a whole introduction would be too boring, but he's who I got this Jekyll blog template from). And I'm probably going to do it. Not that I should immediately start LinkedIn-posting and delving into the system, but just in his words, think of being less of a "postmodernist." 
- I don't *need* to enjoy everything as much as I normally would, and it should be okay to do unlikable things like cram --- even if from an outside perspective, it's annoying, systemic, and boring.
- I don't *need* to resist posting formal Tweets or bragging on my LinkedIn because it's not "me," because does Tweeting with better grammar and in more complete sentences really take away from who I am --- a few changes and I could reasonably have a better future.
- I don't *need* to avoid going to networking events to work on my own projects just because I don't feel like "using" people (having gone to a few, they're actually a bit interesting and I just enjoyed the conversation)
- I don't *need* to dislike finance and selling out if it's the best thing I can do to, in the end, help others, be intellectually challenges, or have a good job (obviously I wouldn't stick around longterm).
- ... And there are probably many other things.

I can give a talk and *want* to look like the archetypal CS guy --- one who probably doesn't shower, has weird tendencies, and stutters --- unironically. People think better in archetypes, and being nonchalant doesn't look good. Calmness does not convince people of dedication when they view things at a distance. And I can still in some sense, be myself. I am playing a version of myself, deliberately, which is not something that I would've liked before. But what's the tradeoff? Maybe a little, maybe a lot.

So why am I going to be more serious? I think it's a bit of a game. A bit of not missing out. A bit of try things out. A bit of I should (according to some umpteenth intuition inside of me). And I guess a bit of --- at the end of the day, I do have an idea of the person I am, and the person I am is the sort of person to take inspiration and become "serious." So even if this reasoning is postmodern, absurdist, somehow a little backwards, I think it's at least interesting. Really, it's a question of why not? I'm still me.
